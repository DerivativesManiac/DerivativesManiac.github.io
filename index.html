				Strategy characteristics include:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Return since inception:</b> 73.4%
				</li>
				<li><b>Maximum drawdown:</b> 39.3%
				</li>
				<li><b>Instruments:</b> Stocks/ETFs, Calls/Puts

				</li>
				<li><b>Asset allocation:</b> Stock/Option = 4/1
				</li>
				<li><b>Portfolio size:</b> 4-5
				</li>
			</ul>
			Mainly trade stocks and options listed on HK exchange. Compared to the systematic strategy below, the higher maximum drawdown of this strategy is caused by a more concentrated portfolio.

				The main weakness of Discretionary Option Trading 1.0 traded in 2017-2018 is that the portfolio return is too volatile with
				maximum drawdown being over 70%. To solve this problem, I developed a systematic option trading strategy. Key characteristics include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Return in about 6 months:</b> 80%
				</li>
				<li><b>Maximum drawdown:</b> 19.8%
				</li>
				<li><b>Instruments:</b> Long Call, Long Vol on US stocks
				</li>
				<li><b>Holding period:</b> Weeks
				</li>
				<li><b>Asset allocation:</b> Cash/Option = 4/1
				</li>
				<li><b>Portfolio size:</b> 20-30
				</li>
				<li>Quantitative entry and exit triggers
				</li>
				<li>
					Maintain Long Vol positions to protect the portfolio against market crash
			</li>
				
			</ul>

			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><b>Total return:</b> 500%
				</li>
				<li><b>Maximum drawdown:</b> 72%
				</li>
				<li><b>Instruments:</b> Long Call, Long Vol on US stocks

			<p>
				From the chart on the right, you may notice that the accumulative P&L is positively correlated with S&P Index. This is because the main component of the portfolio was long calls. In addition, Long Vol positions
				did protect the portfolio at the beginning of 2018 when the market crashed. Below are several key opportunities that I captured during the trading period of 2017-2018:
				<ul>
				    <li><b>Energy (OIL US):</b> I closely followed a fundamental investor called HFIR on Seeking Alpha in 2017-2018. He is an expert in Crude Oil research. Based on supply/demand data
					provided by him and my own quantitative signals, I made a home run in 2018Q1 by long OIL calls.</li>
				    <li><b>Biotech (XBI US):</b> Immuno-oncology, a game changing technique to cure blood cancer, was hot in 2017-2018. I bought 30 biotech stocks that involved Immuno-oncology therapies. 3 of them got
					accquired during 2017-2018. They were Kite Pharma, Juno Therapeutics, and Ablynx NV. My little Kite even ranked <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/lists-tr50/what-are-the-50-smartest-companies/">
					    7th in the list of 50 smartest companies selected by MIT Tech Review in 2017</a>.</li>
				    <li><b>Retail (XRT US):</b> Retail sector plunged by about 20% in 2017H1 due to the consensus belief that online shoppoing (i.e. Amazon) would destroy the retail business. While I believed that Amazon would have 
					negative impact on department stores such as Macy's and Target, it would also boost the revenue of retail companies who have their own brands such as Ralph Lauren and Nike. 
					The beauty of XRT US is that it is a price-weighted ETF and only a few names among over 100 constituents are department stores. I put on a long Vega trade as I believed correlations among ETF constituents would go up once the consensus regime changes, 
					    which would push the volatility of the ETF up.</li>
				</ul>
